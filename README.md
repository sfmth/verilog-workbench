<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project aims to ease the setup of your verilog projects by providing you with a precoded workbench.

### Built With

* `Icarus Verilog (iverilog)` To simulate your verilog code
* `Cocotb` To verify your verilog code by writing python testbenches
* `GTKWave` To view the input or outpot waveforms of your design 
* `Yosys` To synthesize your design into actual hardware and view it



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

For the project to work you would have to install these things first:

* [Icarus Verilog](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/usage/installation.html)
* [Cocotb](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/install.html)
* [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)
* [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/download.html)

Debian 12 Bookworm:
```
$ sudo apt install iverilog yosys gtkwave verilator
# WARNING: Using "--break-system-packages" could break your system. it is recommended to use a python venv instead
$ pip install --break-system-packages cocotb
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sfmth/verilog-workbench/ && cd verilog-workbench
   ```




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
To run a simulation, first you would have to write your verilog code and testbench. You can put your Verilog code in `verilog-workbench/src/` and your test bench in `verilog-workbench/test`. Each verilog file should include only a single module and also the name of the file has to be the same as the module name. For cocotb python test benches it is mandatory to add `test_` to the beginning of the module name and use it as the file name for the corresponding module. There is also a need to add a dump code snippet to the end of your module, you can find it in src/encoder.v.


Then, in order to run the simulation you can do:
```sh
make gtkwave NAM=<module name> SINGLE=<True / False>
```

And if you want to see your synthesized design you can do:
```sh
make show_synth_png NAM=<module name>
```
Or for a more detailed gate level synthesize you can run the following:
```sh
make show_synth_full_svg NAM=<module name>
```
